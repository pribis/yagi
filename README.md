## Yet Another Gam Interface


YAGI stands for “Yet Another GAM Interface” and is specifically intended as an interface for 
GAM which, in turn, is google’s toolset.  GAM can be used directly, but remembering all of 
the commands and parameters can be onerous. YAGI is intended to make things easier by providing
a menu driven interface to help walk a user through the most common tasks.


I started this project to be included with a sysadmin toolchain I use at a place
I work. It was just a simple way to make things a bit easier for me. Here's
to hoping you find some use for it.
